# Dissertation-on-Blood-Product-Usage
These are the codes to my dissertation that was completed in SAS.

The codes are all of the codes that were used in my dissertation that was published through Texas A&M. There are 5 chapters to the dissertation each on a different aspect of the major analysis. There was a systematic review completed, an analysis on data exploration and demographics to see who was receiving blood products at the hospital, what were the most important factors contributing to the receipt of blood prodcuts based on MAP, what were the most important factors contributing to receipt of blood products at all, and there was also a correlation analysis completed at the end. Alls of the coding was done in SAS 9.4 and is still being worked with today to help with further research.
